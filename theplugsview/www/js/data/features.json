Their voices are so harmonious and soft. They sing with such finesse and make lovely music together. The crowd just adores this group. As they enter the stage, you can hear the adoration from the crowd. Many of them were holding up signs and screaming their names. Twins have just a stage presence about themselves. They appeared so graceful on the stage as they serenaded us with their soothing voices. There were times when they would turn to each other and sing. The crowd participated while they sung their songs by swaying back and forth or rocking side to side. They had lovely dancers in the background holding up signs that told us the story of the song. It was beautiful and touching. The lighting in the back was very colorful and went well with their awesome stylish outfits.",
