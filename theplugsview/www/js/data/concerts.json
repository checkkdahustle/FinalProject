Garth is performing 11 shows at Target Center in Downtown Minneapolis this month between Nov. 6 and Nov. 15. More than 200,000 tickets were reportedly sold for these concerts, creating an incredible buzz around Downtown Minneapolis and drawing visitors from all over the region into our community.It’s no surprise this is happening. Garth, who ushered in this era’s country music stars by dominating the 1990s with his collection of iconic hits and high-energy shows, was destined to make a big splash in Downtown Minneapolis when he announced he’d be stopping here on his comeback tour. He last performed here in 1998, and his popularity has not waned in the 16 years since. I think there’s a reason for this. His music is untouchable, for one. If you enjoy country music, it’s impossible not to like Garth’s incredible streak of hits that began in the late 1980s and stretched through more than a decade.",
